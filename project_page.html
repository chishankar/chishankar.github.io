  <h3>CMSC131: Introduction to Object Oriented Programming <p>Fall 2016</p></h3>
  <div class="container format">
    <h4>Project 1: CrypoQuiz & Multilingual Greetings <p>Language: Java</p></h4>
    <div>This project was designed as an introduction to Java. It was meant to introduce
    the concept of user input, if/else statements, booleans, primitive types.</div>

    <h4>Project 2: CryptoCode <p>Language: Java</p></h4>
    <div>This project was designed to introduce the concepts of string manipulation and casting.</div>

    <h4>Project 3: Flag Maker <p>Language: Java</p></h4>
    <div>This project involved us creating colored flags that represented country flags. The point
    of this project was to learn and practice the function single and nested for loops, while loops,
    using methods, understanding objects/classes and user input.</div>

    <h4>Project 4: Photo Tools <p>Language: Java</p></h4>
    <div>This project involved us creating a photo editor.The point of this project was to understand using
      parameters, methods, for loops and objects/classes. We were required to implement the following: </div>
        <ul>
          <li>Making a copy of the photo</li>
          <li>Blue filter</li>
          <li>Grayscale effect</li>
          <li>Artsy effect</li>
          <li>Censoring effect</li>
          <li>Stretched effect</li>
          <li>Mirror effect</li>
          <li>Rotation</li>
       </ul>


   <h4>Project 5: Martian Cubic Calculator <p>Language: Java</p></h4>
   <div>This project involved us creating a polynomial calculator that calculated the basic calculations.
   The concept of this project was to get comfortable with modifiers (public, static, final, etc...), method
   overloading, string manipulation, 'this' keyword to current objects, and object manipulationand creating student
   tests to test our code.</div>

   <h4>Project 6: Poker <p>Language: Java</p></h4>
   <div>This project involved us creating a hand evaluator/poker project to evaluate cards and correctly identify
   the type of hand and ranking. This project was designed to introduce us to array data structures, objects, creating methods,
   writing student tests, and object manipulation.</div>

   <h4>Project 7: Battleable <p>Language: Java</p></h4>
   <div>This project involved us creating objects or objects with characteristics that battle each other. This project was
   designed for us to understand the concept of creating a class, methods, data structures, enums, and past concepts
 from preivous projects. </div>
