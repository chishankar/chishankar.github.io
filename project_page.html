    functional pointers, and linked lists.</div>

    <h4>Project 5: Bag<p>Language: C</p></h4>
    <div>A Bag structure project to practice dynamic memory allocation, linked-lists, and creating Makefiles.</div>

    <h4>Project 6: Assembly<p>Language: Y-86 Assembly</p></h4>
    <div>Writing recursive assembly programs using the ebp frame and esp stack pointer. We used Y-86 assembly which in
    close to x86 Assembly </div>

    <h4>Project 7: Shell<p>Language: C</p></h4>
    <div>Implemented a Shell. Practice with Unix IO.</div>

  </div>

  <h3>CMSC132: Object Oriented Programming II <p>Spring 2017</p> </h3>
  <div class="format">
    <h4>Project 1: Conference <p>Language: Java</p></h4>
    <div>This project was an introduction to organizing data structures. We created a conference class, which consisted of
    game objects, which consisted of player objects. The concept was to practice with private modifiers, Arrays, ArrayLists,
    ,setter and getter methods, and student tests to throughly test the code.</div>

    <h4>Project 2: TA Manager <p>Language: Java</p></h4>
    <div>This projects was designed to manage TA's via Object Array Lists and Inheritance.</div>

    <h4>Project 3: LinkedLists <p>Language: Java</p></h4>
    <div>This project involved creating a Link List data structure in order and throwing exceptions. </div>

    <h4>Project 4: Recursive Lists<p>Language: Java</p></h4>
    <div>This project is an introduction to recursive functions/methods, generic types, and inheritance.</div>

   <h4>Project 5: Power <p>Language: Java</p></h4>
   <div>This project was to introduce Iterators and Inhertiance.</div>

   <h4>Project 6: Polymorhpic Binary Search Trees <p>Language: Java</p></h4>
   <div>This project was to introduce Polymorphic Binary Search Trees, Singleton Program Structure, Key/Value Pairs, and Generic Types </div>

   <h4>Project 7: Bag & Course List<p>Language: Java</p></h4>
   <div>This project was focused on HashMaps and Maps as data structures to organize and store data.</div>

   <h4>Project 8: Graphs<p>Language: Java</p></h4>
   <div>This project on creating a graph structure that consisted of a Map with a nested Hashmap and vertices to created
   a weighted graph data structure.</div>

   <h4>Project 9: Names<p>Language: Java</p></h4>
   <div>This project used a Map with a nested HashMap data structure to store information. In addition, this project
   utilized threads and thread synchronization techniques to parse websites for popular baby names and store them in the
 data structure for easy access. </div>
  </div>


  <h3>CMSC131: Introduction to Object Oriented Programming <p>Fall 2016</p></h3>
  <div class="format">
    <h4>Project 1: CrypoQuiz & Multilingual Greetings <p>Language: Java</p></h4>
    <div>This project was designed as an introduction to Java. It was meant to introduce
    the concept of user input, if/else statements, booleans, primitive types.</div>

    <h4>Project 2: CryptoCode <p>Language: Java</p></h4>
    <div>This project was designed to introduce the concepts of string manipulation and casting.</div>

    <h4>Project 3: Flag Maker <p>Language: Java</p></h4>
    <div>This project involved us creating colored flags that represented country flags. The point
    of this project was to learn and practice the function single and nested for loops, while loops,
    using methods, understanding objects/classes and user input.</div>

    <h4>Project 4: Photo Tools <p>Language: Java</p></h4>
    <div>This project involved us creating a photo editor.The point of this project was to understand using
      parameters, methods, for loops and objects/classes. We were required to implement the following: </div>
        <ul>
          <li>Making a copy of the photo</li>
          <li>Blue filter</li>
          <li>Grayscale effect</li>
          <li>Artsy effect</li>
          <li>Censoring effect</li>
          <li>Stretched effect</li>
          <li>Mirror effect</li>
          <li>Rotation</li>
       </ul>

   <h4>Project 5: Martian Cubic Calculator <p>Language: Java</p></h4>
   <div>This project involved us creating a polynomial calculator that calculated the basic calculations.
   The concept of this project was to get comfortable with modifiers (public, static, final, etc...), method
   overloading, string manipulation, 'this' keyword to current objects, and object manipulationand creating student
   tests to test our code.</div>

   <h4>Project 6: Poker <p>Language: Java</p></h4>
   <div>This project involved us creating a hand evaluator/poker project to evaluate cards and correctly identify
   the type of hand and ranking. This project was designed to introduce us to array data structures, objects, creating methods,
   writing student tests, and object manipulation.</div>

   <h4>Project 7: Battleable <p>Language: Java</p></h4>
   <div>This project involved us creating objects or objects with characteristics that battle each other. This project was
   designed for us to understand the concept of creating a class, methods, data structures, enums, and past concepts
 from preivous projects. </div>
