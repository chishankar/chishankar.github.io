      <h2>Intro to Learning:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
        <b>Learning:</b> is the process of accumulating knowledge via experience & practice, an enduring change in behavior as a result of practice & experience
        <br> Two types : <b>Declaritive</b> and <b>Prodecural</b>
        <br>Declaritive refers to past events, meanings of concepts, and significance of things
        <br>Proceadural refers to the skills that learned, such as playing an instrument, stimulus -> response
        <br> Behaviors are based on antecedent stimulus, <u>without</u> conscious reflection. Does not require conscious
        processing like Declaritive memory. This makes this type of learning more efficient.
        </li>
        <li>
          To study learning, we look for changes in an organisms <b>behavior</b> (Any activity of an organism that can be measured)
          <br>However, change in behavior may not reflect learning in part due to
          <ul>
            <li><b>Fatigue</b> If the animal is too tired to continue, muscle fatigue</li>
            <li><b>Maturation</b> Once the animal begins to mature, (Giraffe grass/tree example)</li>
            <li><b>Movtivation</b> Once the animals thirst/hunger is satisfied</li>
          </ul>
          <b>Latent Learning: </b> is a type of learning that is dormant until such time as it is needed. (Bus/school example)
          <br><b>Devaluation: </b> when a person attributes themselves, an object, or another personal as completley flawed and negative
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>History of Learning Theory</b>
          <br><b>Rene Descartes: </b> DUALISM -> Reflexes are involuntary and there is a automatic response to a stimulus. Said that stimlulus is detected by sensory organs
          <br><b>John Locke: </b> Experiences define out knowledge.
          <br><b>Aristotle: </b>
            <ul>
              <li>Contiguity: is where 2 events occur together</li>
              <li>Similarity: is where 2 events are similar to each other</li>
              <li>Frequency: is where events occur together in a period of time</li>
            </ul>
